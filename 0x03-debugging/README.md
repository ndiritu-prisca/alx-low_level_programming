## Task 0.
Create a file named 0-main.c. This file must test that the function
positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.

## Task 1.
Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that
is causing the output to go into an infinite loop. Don’t add or remove any lines
of code, as we will be checking your line count. You are only allowed to comment
out existing code.

## Task 2.
Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the
largest of three numbers, no matter the case.

## Task 3.
Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly
for all dates and all leap years.
